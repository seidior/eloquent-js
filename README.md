# Eloquent JavaScript

These are selected answers for the exercises in
[_Eloquent JavaScript_, Third Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/)
by Marijn Haverbeke. They may differ greatly from the exercise answers given by
the book.

To run these exercise answers, you'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended for code
editing.

Then, install dependent packages:

```script
bun install
```

You may need to update `package.json` with updated scripts. There's a crawler to
do so:

```script
bun .
```

To run all tests at once:

```script
bun test
```

This includes test code coverage.

Additionally, some helper scripts have been included for convenience:

| helper   | description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `lint`   | runs the linter (ESLint)       |
| `format` | formats all scripts (Prettier) |
